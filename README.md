# Gene-Expression-Data-Analysis-Software
qPCR (quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction) Data Analysis Software is designed to process and analyze data obtained from qPCR experiments, which quantify gene expression levels by measuring the amplification of DNA in real-time. 

Key features of this qPCR data analysis software include:

1. Quality control and data filtering: Ensures the integrity of the data by identifying outliers, low-quality runs, or inefficient amplifications.

2. Baseline correction and normalization: Automatically corrects for background noise and normalizes data using reference genes or housekeeping genes to account for sample variability.
   
4. Quantification of gene expression: Provides relative or absolute quantification of target gene expression based on Ct (cycle threshold) values or ΔΔCt (delta-delta Ct) methods, allowing comparison between experimental and control groups.
   
6. Statistical analysis: Performs statistical tests, such as ANOVA and TukeyHSD, to determine the significance of gene expression differences across experimental conditions.

7. Visualization tools: Offers graphical representations like amplification curves, standard curves, and bar plots of expression levels to help visualize data.

8. Export and report generation: Facilitates exporting data and generating comprehensive reports for sharing results.
