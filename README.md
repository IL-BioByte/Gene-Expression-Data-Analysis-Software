# Gene-Expression-Data-Analysis
This qPCR (quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction) Data Analysis is designed to process and analyze data obtained from qPCR experiments, which quantify gene expression levels by measuring the amplifications. 

Key features of this qPCR data analysis software include:

1. Auto statistical analysis: Performs statistical tests, such as ANOVA and TukeyHSD, to determine the significance of gene expression differences across experimental conditions.

2. Visualization: Offers graphical representations like bar plots of expression levels comparision (Gene of Interest vs Control), 2D PCA (Principal Component Analysis) plots to help visualize data.

3. Export and report generation: Exporting data and generating reports with statistical analysis and visualization for sharing results.
